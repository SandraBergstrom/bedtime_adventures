Testing:
Name validation:
- 2 names inserted - OK
- Only letters - OK
- Correct name input - OK

Bugs:
- Name validation for only letters will cause an error everytime because of the csv.
    - Created 2 input fields so one for each name instaed. Changed so it validates that there is 3 or more letters in each name.
